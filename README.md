Task 2: Phishing Email Analysis Email analyzed: 

Adobe for Photographers <mail@mail.adobe.com> (10 Oct 2025) 

Steps I followed 

Checked the email header and sender details. 

Verified attachments (none) and looked for suspicious links.

Took screenshots of the email for evidence.

Checked the sender domain and IP against blacklist and reputation databases.
   
Tools used
•	MxToolbox – checked email server, DNS, and blacklist.
   
•	VirusTotal – scanned links and attachments.
    
•	WHOIS/ DNS Lookup – verified IP address registration and domain details.

What I found

•	Sender address looks generic and the email came at an unusual time.

•	No attachments. •	Email content is professional, no obvious spelling/grammar mistakes. 

•	MxToolbox shows blacklist detected and minor configuration warnings (DNS SOA serial format, reverse DNS mismatch).

•	Links should be verified before clicking.

Summary

##3This is a phishing email. 

##It impersonates Adobe, uses deceptive URL tricks and social engineering pressure to coerce the recipient into revealing sensitive information.

##Multiple technical and behavioral indicators confirm high confidence malicious intent.  

##It tries to look like a legitimate site (Adobe), but the actual URL is different.

##The mail@mail.adobe.com format is a common trick anything before @ is treated as a username, not part of the real domain.  

##Phishing sites usually ask you to enter passwords, credit card info, or personal details. 

##Legitimate companies don’t ask this through strange URLs.

##The use of http:// instead of https:// is another red flag real login pages always use secure connections.  

##Phishing emails often push you to act fast (“Your account will be locked!”), trying to make you ignore the warning signs. 

##In short: 

it’s phishing because it pretends to be legitimate, tries to steal sensitive info, and uses URL tricks to fool you.
